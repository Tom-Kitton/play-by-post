								 <p>Dear friends, </p>

								<p>The year is 425 and change is in the air. The war in Doppe is finished but Rhencher forces still mass at the borders of Hitheley. For the first time since reconciliation, the Liberationists are seriously challenged in the elections, struggling to see off Communards in the East and the Restorationists in the West. Ships trading off the Chanchette Bar are sunk by mysterious raiders, their crews disappering without trace. Old monastic texts are stolen from Teilher and Trenchers' gallery in Lemons Hill, and signs are daubed in blood upon their door.</p>

								<p>All around us, society is riven by technological and political transformation. Ponderous empires shake with the rising power of merchant guilds, inventors and mill keepers; governments of compromise struggle against resurgent aristocratic power and radical reformism; great armies and famous generals are humbled by the black sorcery of gunpowder, or the foul wizardry of ancient sects. Everywhere, revolutionary political ideas spread inexorably through the teeming masses of exploited folk, whose aching backs hold up the gaudy edifice of world politics. </p>

								<p>It is for you to decide which path you take through the dark underbelly and the glittering heights of this world, which teeters on the brink of metamorphosis. You will need to use your cunning, creativity and insight to solve eerie mysteries, avert diplomatic catastrophes or untangle ancient riddles. </p>						

								<p>A Traveller's Way is built upon the belief that games are as enriching as they are immersive. It prioritises role- playing, character, and setting over mathematical optimisation and crunchy resolution mechanics. It creates situations where players are able to use their human insight, critical thinking, and problem solving skills to unpick complicated and open-ended scenarios, sifting the clues the story tells them, and using their answers to drive the tale in a direction of their choosing. </p>

								<p>In A TravelLer's Way, there are no correct solutions, no right outcomes and no dead-ends. There is no concept of eternal evil, or idealised right, to which characters might swear their loyalty. Instead, it is a world where your choices and actions will advance or suppress the many agendas and powers of this beautiful and horrifying epoch, each as ethically complicated and compromised and those we know from our own reality.</p>

								<p>Thank you for joining us on the highroad: whether you become a spy, a merchant, a sorceror, or a travelling juggler with a sweet little tame bear, It is you who knows best where we ought next to go.</p>
