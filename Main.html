								 <p>You have arrived at the port of Gorton Lees in the Division of Estilling, a region which sprawls listlessly to the South of Old Westhithe and the Northeast of Deeswich, and is bordered on its Eastern side by the Inner Sea of Cais.</p>
								 <p>Gorton Lees is a small port, which principally serves the inshore fishing trade, but a few passenger boats call here each day, to ferry travellers between Duenstillig, in foreign La Rhenc, and Lemons Hill, the Legislative Capital of the Queens Chain.</p> 
								 <p>Unusually for a city of sailors, Gorton Lees has but the one wharf for all its traffic, meaning the sundry cargoes of the inshore trade are heaped in crates and slovely nets around you and your fellow passengers. Your own small case, heavy enough in your hand, is dwarfed by the tons of miscellaneous goods which tower over you; piles of baled tea and rolls of adding paper slewing over littered mail packets and parcels of raw cloth. A foul mulch of coal and old vegetable leaves is slimed over the cobbles at your feet. Though the breeze is fresh enough, the stink of herrings and carweys from the fishing sloops which lie at anchor is scarcely to be believed.</p>
								 <p>Standing on the Quay, you can see a trading bank, a tavern, the Gorton Lees customs house, a beadlery tower, and a carriage exchange. Stevedores and sailing folk beetle about between the towers of goods, calling to one an other in Bray and the Sailor's Cant. Urchins and Writ Carriers loiter outside the tavern, scanning the crowd for easy game.</p>
