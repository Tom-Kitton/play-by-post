								 <p>A Play by Post roleplaying game is an experience wherein players and game-runners explore a world together through collaborative storytelling. In A Traveller's Way, this occurs through email, where players send their moves to a central gamerunner, called the Storyteller, who replies with the outcome of their actions. The game has no singular ending or fixed concept of 'winning', each player's game continues for as long as is necessary to bring their's story to a close. </p>
								 <p>The Wikipedia page about Play by Post Games can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-post_role-playing_game">here</a>, and it contains some interesting examples from the history of the form. Another example of a Play by Post game, which was a great inspiration in setting up A Traveller's Way, is <i>Trace Italian</i>, the game contained in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_in_White_Van">Wolf in White Van</a>, by John Darnielle. Like many of these games, A Traveller's Way prefers exploration, problem-solving, strategy and negotiation to mathematical optimisation and simulation.</p>
