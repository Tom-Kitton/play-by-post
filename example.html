								 <p>I am called Cerft, and I am a traveller in looms. My people, the Tosenti, earn their names by feats in the service of the Graces and I still have only my found name, though I am mature in years. My craft forbids me from making or getting children and I take the words for neither women nor men. For the betterment of my guild, and to better my own renown, I seek new ways to bend cloth. I will get them through fair work, trade or trickery.</p> 
								 <p>I am a free-walker and fellow-craft of my trade and I bear its Arms upon my right brow as a mark of free passage within the Cities of the Chain. Like all of my people, I honour the Twelve Burdens and Thirty-Six Graces, and I have taken
								The-Spider-Binds-With-Longing as my aspect of She the Graceful. Like all the blessed of my aspect, I am cunning, I am slight, and I am skilful. Though I am honoured to bear it, it saddens me that I am disfigured by my Mark and I am ashamed to have seen little of the world beyond the Weaver’s Quarter of Her Grace’s City of Westhithe. I hide these worries with a sharp tongue and try to learn quickly, so that I might not be tricked by those who have seen more of these lands than I.</p>

							<div class="main-text">
								<p>You are standing on the crest of a small hill.</p>

								<p>Behind you, the open country of the Upper Mallos rolls back towards the Gorbenna Ranges, their highest peaks bare and dun-coloured in the afternoon light. Squinting against the sky, you can still see the small pass through which you crossed them three days before. </p>

								<p>Beside you, atop the hill, stands a large wooden building, with a courtyard paved in irregular stones. It is a customs house of the inner border, its name printed in Uncial and Trader’s Cant below the carved arms of the Queen’s Chain. The fields around the walls are dry and weathered, but you can see rows of apple trees and grapevines picking out a crooked tapestry down the slopes, towards the river and the higher hills behind.</p>

								<p>Other travellers, perhaps a dozen in all, sit in the shade of its boundary walls. Some are smoking or reading and others are talking in small groups. One group is made of bare backed men, their skin sun-freckled, who wear only leather breeches and tight bonnets of black cloth. Another is dressed like merchants of the Cities, men and women in fine doublets, rounded caps and embroidered cassocks. Everyone you can see is sweating in the heat.

								<p>Every so often one of the travellers will get up to drink from the well at the courtyard’s centre.</p>

								<p>Further ahead, just past the brow of the hill, you can see a milestone and a large cairn strewn with flags. Some are faded but others catch the light and shine in little flashes of orange and purple. The road ahead is dusty and dry but it has been beaten firm by many feet.</p>

								<p>Below it, you can see a river to your right and more dry fields to the left. Small figures are washing clothes where the water speeds over shallow stones. On the path, a band of herders is leading a ragged chain of donkeys and mules towards you. There is a man in a purple coat and a helmet standing in their path.</p>

								<p>You have heard that the villages ahead are rich and peaceful, getting larger as you approach the town of Lemon’s Hill. Your people and your land are days behind and far away, across the peaks.</p>

								<p>Your bag is heavy on your shoulders and your feet are hot and sore with the day's walking.</p>

								<p><div class="side-label-right">Cerft's First Move</div></p>
								<div class="main-text">
								<p>I walk to the fountain in the centre of the courtyard and fill my flask with water. Out of the corners of my eyes, I look at the different groups of people lingering around the walls. All of them seem dangerously respectable and comfortable for someone as precariously situated as myself.</p>
								<p>Once the flask is full, I shoulder my bag and weaving frame and walk to the official person standing on the highroad, the one with the helmet. "Excuse me," I say, "How long would it take to walk to the nearest large town- a town large enough to have a market of any size?"</p>
								</div>

								<p><div class="side-label-right">The Second Moment, as Told by the Storyteller</div></p>
								<div class="main-text"> 
								<p>As you turn to the road, you look over the wall and past the river, the late afternoon’s light turning violet and mauve, painting small scuffs of cloud that chase above the low hills. Behind you, the Gorbenna ranges look aflame.</p>

								<p>By the river, the clothes-washers are finishing their work and singing some kind of round, their words in Fabre and each part pitched at intervals to the others. It is a fast song but also sad. The eldest, bodies stooped and leaden, carry baskets filled with dull, taupe cloth. The smallest, who are mere children, run ahead of them, playing with hoops and bells. </p>

								<p>As you speak, the official's eyes flick from the approaching herders to your face and back again. They seem, for a moment, not to have heard you. Then, eyes still on the road ahead, they begin to speak quietly. "The nearest market such as you ask for is that of Brownrigg and Kiels, the twin villages, which lioe some two hours walk away on the South road." He shifts his weight from one leg to the other and scuffs a boot through the dry grass at the road's edge. "But I'd advise caution on Twin Village Path, as leads from the highroad to the Market Lane. There's been some strongly worded bills posted up in those parts of late, saying hard things about itnerants." He looks at you hard, eye to eye, but still seeming to take in your guild mark and your worn travelling robes. "I'd watch hard for well -dressed lads is all I mean by it, really," He says, cracking the ghost of a smile, "There's not so many beadles to ask advice once you're off the main road."</p>

								<p>Wind soughs through the apple orchard and tickles at the edges of your robes. You can see the highroad winding Northerly ahead, the herders trudging through its dust, the Brownrigg and Kiels road a little to its South, deserted, and the Customs House behind.</p>
								</div>

								<p><div class="side-label-right">Cerft's Second Move</div></p>
								<div class="main-text"> 
								<p>I thank the beadle for his advice and draw my hood forward over my brows to hide my guild mark. I begin along the Brownrigg and Kiels Road, alert to what passes in the twilight ahead, and ready to step into the brush on either side at the first sign of other travellers.</p>
								<p>I watch the skies as I walk, taking in the sunset and thinking about how I will pay for the next stages of my journey once I reach the market. I currently intend to sell fancy weavings thrown up on my loom, family crests, scenes from history and the like, which are always popular in the provincial markets. I have a great book of such patterns in the odds drawer under the loom's bobbin case.</p>
								<p>I walk and think until something further happens to stop or alarm me.</p>
